<html><body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#333333"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td>A government policy will lead to 
a particular outcome for 
each person involved. A policy is &quot;suboptimal&quot; if there exists an alternative 
policy that will not worsen the outcome for anyone and that will provide 
a better outcome for at least one person.  A policy that is not suboptimal 
is called a &quot;Pareto Optimum&quot;. There 
may be many Pareto Optima.
<p>
Create a class Pareto that contains a method optima that takes 
a string[] <b>policy</b> as input.
Each element of <b>policy</b> gives the outcome from one policy 
choice.  Your method should return the number of policy
choices that are Pareto Optimal.
</p><p>
Each element of <b>policy</b> will be formatted 
as &quot;[feeling] [feeling] [feeling] ...&quot;
where each [feeling] describes the outcome for the corresponding 
person. There will 
be no leading or trailing spaces, and there will be exactly one space between 
each pair of adjacent [feeling].
</p><p>
Each [feeling] is one of the following strings, (given 
in order of increasing satisfaction)<ul>
    <li>&quot;awful&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;fair&quot;, &quot;fairly-happy&quot;, &quot;happy&quot;, &quot;ecstatic&quot;</li> </ul>

 There are four people affected by our choice of 
policy. The second policy is suboptimal
when compared to the first policy. Neither the first nor the third 
policy is suboptimal (the second person would prefer the first 
policy over the third policy, while the first person would prefer the third policy).
So the first and third policies are Pareto Optimal.
