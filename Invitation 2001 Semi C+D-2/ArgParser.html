TOURNAMENT

PROBLEM STATEMENT
One of the problems that TopCoder has run into is how to parse a String[] from
the command line. To do this, we've adopted the following convention for a
String representation of a String[] (quotes are used for clarity only):
&quot;{&lt;element1&gt;, &lt;element2&gt;, ... , &lt;elementN&gt;}&quot;, where the input String begins
with a beginning curly brace,  each String element in the input String (except
the last one) is followed by a comma and a space, and the last one is followed
by an end curly brace. However, there are a couple of tricks:

* each individual String element may contain commas or curly braces (or both).
In each case, an escape character ('\') will precede commas and curly braces
that are actually *within* the String element.
* a backslash ('\') does not necessarily mean the following character needs to
be escaped. If it does not precede a comma or curly brace, it is to be
considered part of the String element.
* an empty String element is a valid parameter, and is indicated by no
character preceding a delimiting comma and a space (see examples below).
* &quot;{}&quot; returns an array with an empty String element {&quot;&quot;}.

Additionally, there are certain cases where the input String is invalid that
you will need to catch. Those situations are:
* if the input string doesn't begin with an open curly brace and end with a
closed curly brace
* if any curly brace inside the opening and closing curly braces are not
escaped.
* if any comma that serves as a delimiter fails to have a space after it

In cases such as these, return a String[] consisting of exactly one element:
&quot;INVALID&quot;

Your task is to create a class ArgParser that includes a method parse. This
method will take a String representation of a String[], and return the
corresponding String[].

DEFINITION
Class Name:  ArgParser
Method Name:  parse
Parameters:  String
Returns:  String[]
Method signature (be sure your method is public):  String[] parse(String input);

TopCoder will ensure that the input string will only contain characters A-Z,
a-z, 0-9, '{', '}', spaces (' '), commas (',') and backslashes ('\').  The
String should have a length between 0 and 50, inclusive.

EXAMPLES
&quot;{a, b, c}&quot; -&gt; {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;} (3 items)
&quot;{a\,b, c}&quot; -&gt; {&quot;a,b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;} (2 items)
&quot;{, , a, }&quot; -&gt; {&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;&quot;} (4 items)
&quot;{\\, \,\, }&quot; -&gt; {&quot;\, ,, &quot;} (1 item)
&quot;{\ , \,, }&quot; -&gt; {&quot;\ &quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;&quot;} (3 items)
&quot;{}&quot; -&gt; {&quot;&quot;} (1 item)
